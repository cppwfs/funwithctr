= Sample Composed Task Runner Tour

The purpose of this project is to provide an outline on building a Composed Task Tree in Spring Cloud Data Flow.

== Overview
This tour has a task application that allows the user to specify the Task Exit Message via a property.
This allows the user to test various transition paths through a Composed Task directed graph.

=== Building the Application
To build the application:
```
mvn clean install
```
To build the docker image:
```
mvn dockerfile:build
```

=== Transitions
Transitions allow users to specify the branch of a tree they want the flow to follow.
A task transition is represented by the following symbol ->.
So lets create a basic transition graph.

image::{image-root}/basictransition1.png[basic transition]

First let's register our testapp application using the shell

```
app register --name transition-app --type task --uri maven://io.spring:taskapp:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
```

Now Let's create this basic transition where the branches will be timestamps but each timestamp will have a unique label.  From your shell run the following command:
```
task create basictransition --definition "transition-app 'FAILED'->timestamp-1: timestamp 'COMPLETED'->timestamp-2: timestamp"
```

Now let's launch our composed task a couple of times so that we can exercise its paths through the tree.

First let's see what happens if we set the exit message to "FAILED"
```
task launch basictransition --arguments "--increment-instance-enabled=true --interval-time-between-checks=1000" --properties "app.basictransition.transition-app.taskapp.exitMessage=FAILED"
```

Now that it has been executed let's verify that path `FAILED` was acutally followed and this can be done by executing:
```
task execution list
```
And we should see:
```
╔══════════════════════════════╤═══╤════════════════════════════╤════════════════════════════╤═════════╗

╚══════════════════════════════╧═══╧════════════════════════════╧════════════════════════════╧═════════╝
```
This shows us that the composed task runner controlling the composed task execution `basic-transition` was launched and the `transition-app` was launched.
From there the proper `FAILED` branch was executed as denoted by `basictransition-timestamp-1` was launched.

Now if we relaunch the composed-task-runner but this time we do not set taskapp.exitMessage we should exercise the other branch for example from the shell execute the following:
```
task launch basictransition --arguments "--increment-instance-enabled=true --interval-time-between-checks=1000"
```
Now that it has been executed let's verify that `COMPLETED` was acutally followed and this can be done by executing:
```
task execution list
```
And we should see:
```

```

==== What did I just do?

Wait a minute...  What is all that stuff I put in the command line?
So for this example we wanted to show how to use both command line args and properties.
We used the arguments to establish the properties for the Composed Task Runner:

1. `--increment-instance-enabled=true` states that we want to be able to execute this Composed Task multiple times.   (Composed Tasks are build using Spring Batch and thus are batch jobs)
2. `--interval-time-between-checks=1000` states that the composed task runner will wait 1 second between checks to make sure that a task is complete (the default is 10 seconds).

We used the properties to set the `transition-app` properties.   Notice we had 4 sections for the `taskapp.exitMessage` property lets breakdown the `app.basictransition.transition-app.taskapp.exitMessage=FAILED` into its components:

1. `app` tells spring cloud dataflow that this property is to be used for task application.
2. `basictransition` tells dataflow that this property will be used by the composed task runner or one of the apps in the graph
3. `transition-app` tells dataflow that this property is to be used by the `transition-app`
4. `taskapp.exitMessage` the property itself.

==== Are there more states to a transition?
Now what happens if I were to enter "FOO" for the exit message what would happen?   Well lets try it!
```
task launch basictransition --arguments "--increment-instance-enabled=true --interval-time-between-checks=1000" --properties "app.basictransition.transition-app.taskapp.exitMessage=FOO"
```

Now that it has been executed let's see the result:
```
task execution list
```
And we should see:
```
╔══════════════════════════════╤═══╤════════════════════════════╤════════════════════════════╤═════════╗
║          Task Name           │ID │         Start Time         │          End Time          │Exit Code║
╠══════════════════════════════╪═══╪════════════════════════════╪════════════════════════════╪═════════╣
║basictransition-transition-app│109│Sat Sep 28 12:31:30 EDT 2019│Sat Sep 28 12:31:30 EDT 2019│0        ║
║basictransition               │108│Sat Sep 28 12:31:27 EDT 2019│Sat Sep 28 12:31:30 EDT 2019│0        ║
╚══════════════════════════════╧═══╧════════════════════════════╧════════════════════════════╧═════════╝
```
In this case we see that the composed task ended with just running the composed task runner and the transition app.
This was because FOO was not targeted.   How would we handle that?  i.e. have a path for `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, and everything else?

In this case would want to create another composed task using a wild card that would look like:

image::{image-root}/basictransition2.png[basic transition with wild card]

Let's create this composed task as follows using the shell:
```
task create anothertransition --definition "transition-app 'FAILED'->timestamp-1: timestamp 'COMPLETED'->timestamp-2: timestamp '*' -> timestamp-3:timestamp"
```

Now let's try executing that again using our new `anothertransition` composed task:
```
task launch anothertransition --arguments "--increment-instance-enabled=true --interval-time-between-checks=1000" --properties "app.anothertransition.transition-app.taskapp.exitMessage=FOO"
```

Now that it has been executed let's see the result:
```
task execution list
```
And we should see:
```
╔════════════════════════════════╤═══╤════════════════════════════╤════════════════════════════╤═════════╗
║           Task Name            │ID │         Start Time         │          End Time          │Exit Code║
╠════════════════════════════════╪═══╪════════════════════════════╪════════════════════════════╪═════════╣
║anothertransition-timestamp-3   │115│Sat Sep 28 12:44:55 EDT 2019│Sat Sep 28 12:44:55 EDT 2019│0        ║
║anothertransition-transition-app│114│Sat Sep 28 12:44:53 EDT 2019│Sat Sep 28 12:44:53 EDT 2019│0        ║
║anothertransition               │113│Sat Sep 28 12:44:50 EDT 2019│Sat Sep 28 12:44:56 EDT 2019│0        ║
╚════════════════════════════════╧═══╧════════════════════════════╧════════════════════════════╧═════════╝
```
In this case we see that the wildcard catches all other exit messages and this can be seen in that anothertransition-timestamp-3 was launched.

=== Splits
What if we want to execute multiple tasks at the same time.   This can be done by using the split.
Let's say we want  to execute 3 apps simultaneously and once they all complete we want to execute the remainder of our tree. Like this

image::{image-root}/splitgraph.png[split graph]

Let's create this composed task as follows using the shell:
```
task create splitgraph --definition "<split1: timestamp ||split2: timestamp  ||split3: timestamp>  && transition-app 'FAILED'->timestamp-1: timestamp 'COMPLETED'->timestamp-2: timestamp '*' -> timestamp-3:timestamp"
```

Now let's execute `splitgraph` composed task:
```
task launch splitgraph --arguments "--increment-instance-enabled=true --interval-time-between-checks=1000 --split-thread-core-pool-size=4" --properties "app.splitgraph.transition-app.taskapp.exitMessage=FOO"
```

Now that it has been executed let's see the result:
```
task execution list
```
And we should see:
```
╔════════════════════════════════╤═══╤════════════════════════════╤════════════════════════════╤═════════╗
║           Task Name            │ID │         Start Time         │          End Time          │Exit Code║
╠════════════════════════════════╪═══╪════════════════════════════╪════════════════════════════╪═════════╣

║splitgraph-split2               │119│Sat Sep 28 13:05:26 EDT 2019│Sat Sep 28 13:05:27 EDT 2019│0        ║
║splitgraph-split3               │117│Sat Sep 28 13:05:26 EDT 2019│Sat Sep 28 13:05:26 EDT 2019│0        ║
║splitgraph                      │116│Sat Sep 28 13:05:21 EDT 2019│Sat Sep 28 13:05:33 EDT 2019│0        ║
╚════════════════════════════════╧═══╧════════════════════════════╧════════════════════════════╧═════════╝
```
In this example we see that the split1-3 were fired simultaneously before ctr launched our transition app.
And we added a new argument `--split-thread-core-pool-size=4`  This basically states that the composed task runner can run 4 apps simultaneously.
