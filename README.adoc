= Sample Composed Task Runner Tour

The purpose of this project is to provide an outline on building a Composed Task Tree in Spring Cloud Data Flow.

== Overview
This tour has a task application that allows the user to specify the Task Exit Message via a property.
This allows the user to test various transition paths through a Composed Task directed graph.

=== Transitions
Transitions allow users to specify the branch of a tree they want the flow to follow.
A task transition is represented by the following symbol ->.
So lets create a basic transition graph.
